# spotify-template
The instructions are described [here](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/spotify).

What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
I created a web app that would let people select an artist, they want to hear and then filter the choices by track name, album name or both.  When the user clicks on an album cover, they get a preview of the track, as well as 10 of the most recent instagram photos that have the artist's name hashtag in common - so for example. clicking on a coldplay song would show instagram images tagged with #coldplay.

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.

Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
Honestly I have no idea.  I've probably spent almost 48 hours on it, but it's hard to say.  I started last Monday and have worked on it for at minimum 4-5 hours per day since then, but probably more.

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
Understanding the Spotify API was very difficult.  I think I spent my first three days trying to figure out the API, and for some reason was just very unclear on how it worked.  However, i think this might be part of the learning process too.  It made using the Instagram API that much easier.  I would make a very strong recommendation to start really early though.
